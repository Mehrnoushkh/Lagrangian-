# Lagrangian Particle Tracking in Ocean Flows

This repository contains code and results related to the Lagrangian analysis of oceanic transport using both raw and coarse-grained velocity fields. The work involves comparing particle trajectories, analyzing mesoscale dynamics, and studying the influence of filtering on transport processes.

## Project Goals
- Simulate Lagrangian particle trajectories using original and coarse-grained ocean velocity fields.
- Analyze the difference between Eulerian and Lagrangian transport estimates.
- Classify particle motions (e.g., eddy-like vs drift-like) using clustering techniques.
- Evaluate correlations between small-scale motions and total displacements.
